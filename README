The following source code implements dotnetzip to parse extract data from zip files
as well as recompress back into a new zip file. This source code is meant to serve
as inspiration for anyone trying to use dotnetzip for manipulating zip files. 
The source code will not compile as I have not included any of the .dll's required for it.
